- **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the platform as dog owner or dogsitter so that I can see the preview of a limited amount of users.

- **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can see other users' profiles and get in touch.

- **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it

-**Dashboard** As a user, I have access to my profile details and favourites so I can review them.

- **Favourites:** As a user, I have access to my favourite list so I can edit it.

- **ProfilesBoard** As a user, I can see a list of all the users registered to the platform so I can filter them according to my requirements.
